	# I specifically pointed out that this structure is similar to a dictionary, 
	# because it allows us to use the ampersand operator (&), 
	# which will return us the intersection of these structures
	# For example, if secret = "1123" and guess = "0111", 
	# then Counter(secret) is Counter({\'1\': 2, \'2\': 1, \'3\': 1}), 
	# respectively Counter(guess) is Counter({\'0\': 1, \'1\': 3}) 
	# and Counter(secret) & Counter(guess) is Counter({\'1\': 2})
	# The example shows that in order to get the number of cows, 
	# it remains to subtract the number of bulls from the resulting result
