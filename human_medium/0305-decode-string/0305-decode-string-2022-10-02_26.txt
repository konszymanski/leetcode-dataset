        1.Use a stack and keep appending to the stack until you come across the first closing bracket(\']\')
        2.When you come across the first closing bracket start popping until you encounter an opening bracket(\'[\')),basically iterate unit the top of the stack is not an opening bracket and simultaneously keep on appending it to a seperate variable here its substr
        3.Once that is done iterate unitl the stack is empty and if the top of the stack is a digit and append the popped values to a seperate string variable here its n
        4.Once this is done append n and substr , we do this so that we get the repeated substring
        5.Finally return the stack in a string format using .join
        
        \'\'\'
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i]!="]":
                stack.append(s[i])
            else:
                substr = ""
                while stack[-1]!="[":
                    c = stack.pop()
                    substr = c + substr
                stack.pop()
                n = ""
                while stack and stack[-1].isdigit():
                    nums = stack.pop()
                    n = nums + n
                stack.append(int(n)*substr)
        return "".join(stack)
