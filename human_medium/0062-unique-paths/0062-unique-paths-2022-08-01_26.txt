We have to take total m-1 steps downwards and n-1 steps towards right. 
Hence there are total m+n-2 steps. 
Out of these, we need to choose which m-1 steps should be taken 
downwards (the rest automatically are fixed as right steps). 
Hence the number of different ways to reach bottom right 
from top left becomes (m + n -2) choose (m-1) 
(also equal to (m + n - 2) choose (n-1))

from math import comb
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return comb(m + n - 2, min(m-1, n-1))
