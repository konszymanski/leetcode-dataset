#first we get the length of each list to iterate the longest first, untill they meet, (example:
# 18956 and 204, we want to iterate the first 2 numbers of 18956,
#so when we reach 9 we can add it with 2, which are at the same place in the number. (Hundreds)
#So far O(N) Time and O(1) Space to get/store the lengths.

        len1 = getLength(l1)
        len2 = getLength(l2)
        
# Now we add the two numbers following the rule above, so we will have:
#[1]->[8]->[11]->[5]->[10]
#This will also take O(N), so we\'re currently sitting at O(2N) iterations,
#And still O(1) Space, since we\'re using a fixed number of pointers.

        out = outhead = ListNode()
        lenmax = max(len1,len2)
        lenmin = min(len1,len2)

#Next step is to reverse the list, so we can easily "fix" the cells over 10. The list will look like this:
#[10]->[5]->[11]->[8]->[1]
#Reversing will again take O(N) time and O(1) Space, so we\'re at O(3N) Time now.

		
        #reverse outlist
        head = reverseLinkedList(outhead.next)
        
        #print(prev)
        
#Here we "fix" the cells that have values over 10 now that it\'s easy to move the remaineder to the next spot on the number
#Pretty much what we do here is, if a number is over 10, we apply the % operatior,
#which returns the single digit number, and add 1 to the next number, 
#if its under 10 we do nothing and  continue. The list will look like this:
#[0]->[6]->[1]->[9]->[1]
#Runtime so far O(4N), Space O(1)


        #fix val>10
        curr = head
        
        while curr.next:
            if curr.val >= 10:
                curr.next.val += 1
                curr.val %= 10
            curr = curr.next
        if curr.val >= 10:
                curr.next = ListNode(1)
                curr.val %= 10
        #print(head)

#Then finally, we reverse the linked list 1 last time and return it, as it now is in the proper format.
#Final Runtime O(5N) -> O(N),  Space O(1)
        
        return reverseLinkedList(head)
