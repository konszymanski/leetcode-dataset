        ## LOGIC ##
        #   1. store all edges (bidirectional) with values.
        #   2. start from query[0] and go along edges till you reach query[1] (keep track of ans )
        #   3. make sure to prevent cycles using visited
        #   4. EDGE CASE : query [x2,x4] ideal path should be x2 -> x3 -> x4, but as we are checking for all items in graph[curr] our path will be x2->x1->x2->x3->x4 but as we keeping track of visited, we can\'t bactrack, so remve from visited incase solution not found in that path
