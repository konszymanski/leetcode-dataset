# 1. Any live(1) cell with less than two live neighbors dies(0) as if caused by under-population.
# 2. Any live(1) cell with two or three live neighbors lives(1) on to the next generation.
# 3. Any live(1) cell with more than three live neighbors dies(1), as if by over-population.
# 4. Any dead(0) cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live(1) cell, as if by reproduction.
