class Solution:
    # Travel from left to right and if you find minK assing p1 to it and when you find maxK assing p2 to it
    # When you find p1 and p2 both with valid numbers in between all the numbers left of p1 which are valid
    # will be added to the answer. As you keep travelling right keep adding all the valid numbers from the left of p1
    # as those all will contribute to the answer! Hence wew need a variable to store leftmost id of valid number.
