Hello guys \uD83D\uDE00 !

Given question:
Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

Question Explanation:
What we have to do here \uD83E\uDD14 ? don\'t worry, i will explain you guys \uD83D\uDE04 !!
we have return the corresponding column number for given column title.

    For example:
        columnTitle = "A"
        A -> 1
        \uD83D\uDC49 here our corresponding column number for given column title is 1.

        columnTitle = "AB"
           \uD83D\uDC49 here we have AB so we have to do means:
                A --> 1
                B --> 2
                .
                .
                Z --> 26
                After this what will come means :
                AB --> 1*26 + 2 = 28
                AA --> 27

                 how it came \uD83E\uDD14:
                 AA --> 1 * 26 + 1 = 27
            same as above:
                AB --> 1 * 26 + 2 = 28

            Let me give another Example:
                columnTitle = "CD"
                CD-> 3*26 + 4 = 82

Code Explanation:
1.we have initialized a variable called corresponding_number .
2.then we have start looping and get current letter to find corresponding letter value.
3.we are going to use one formula.
corresponding_number += current_Letter_value * pow(26, length_of_string - i- 1)
    Example: 
        current_letter = "DA"
        corresponding_number = 0
        \u2B50 now we going to start looping:
                \u2B50 i=0
                \u2B50 current_letter = "D"
                \u2B50 corresponding_letter_value = 4
                \u2B50 length_of_string = 2
                corresponding_number += 4 * pow(26, 2 - 0 - 1) ==> 4 * 26^1 =104
                \u2B50 i=1
                \u2B50 current_letter = "A"
                \u2B50 corresponding_letter_value = 1
                \u2B50 length_of_string = 2
                corresponding_number += 1 * pow(26, 2 - 1 - 1) ==> 1 * 26^0 = 1
        now we will return corresponding_number = 104 + 1 = 105

    Big O:
        Time Complexity:O(n) where n is the length of string
        Space Complexity:O(1) constant space
