# IDEA: perform BFS on both original and cloned trees simultaneously using same queue and comparing original nodes to target
#       since trees are the same we will find target at exactly the same moment on both trees; O(N) time, O(N) space
#
class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        que = collections.deque([(original, cloned)]) # start at the root
        while que:
            nodeOrig, nodeClon = que.popleft()
            if nodeOrig is target: # if original node is found - cloned node is our answer
                return nodeClon
            if nodeOrig.left:  que.append((nodeOrig.left, nodeClon.left))
            if nodeOrig.right: que.append((nodeOrig.right, nodeClon.right))
