        1. In general dynamic programming concept, we store maxprofit found till that index in dp[i], but this problem has many states i) buy ii) sell iii) cooldown 
        
        2. if in case of multiple states, what we do in (say DP state machine pattern) is we store maximum for all the possible states i.e
            a) max profit with state = buy,      on day i
            b) max profit with state = cooldown, on day i
            c) max profit with state = sell,     on day i
        
        3. For this problem
            a) dp_buy[i] = we are buying on that day. But as per question you can only buy when previous day is cooldown. so only consider dp_cooldown[i-1] and also buying on day i, will cost you some money i.e price[i]. can be written as:
