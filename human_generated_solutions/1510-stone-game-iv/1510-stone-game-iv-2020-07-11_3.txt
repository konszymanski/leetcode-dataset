For each state i:
	j = find all the perfect squares less than i.
	for each j:
		Assume that the perfectsquare j is taken by alice.
		Then the game continues as` dp[i-j*j]` for bob as start player.
		Since we calculated all answers for such states with alice as start player,its the same even if bob becomes the start player because both play optimally.
		If bob could wins ,alice loses i.e ` dp[i-j*j]` = True
		else if bob loses alice wins    i.e ` dp[i-j*j]`  = False
		So,we choose the case where alice wins with alice as start player(In essence we find if atleast one j returns True for dp[i]). or dp[i] |= ! dp[i-j*j]
