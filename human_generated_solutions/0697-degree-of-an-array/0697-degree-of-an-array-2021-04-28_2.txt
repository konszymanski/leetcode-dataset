        step 1: find the degree
            - create a hashmap of a number and value as list of occurance indices
            - the largest indices array in the hashmap gives us the degree
        step 2: find the minimum length subarray with same degree
            - initialize result as length of array
            - for each indices array, if it\'s length equals degree, means it\'s most frequent element
                - this length will be equal to the difference of first occurance and last occurance of most frequent element
                - compare this length with current result and keep the smallest length as result
            - return result + 1 because difference of indices will give us length - 1
