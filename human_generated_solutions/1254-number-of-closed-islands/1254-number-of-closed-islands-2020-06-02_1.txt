        ## APPROACH : DFS ##
        ## LOGIC ##
        ## 1. Find, Islands just like normal Leetcode 200. Number of Islands problem.
        ## 2. While doing so, check if every land block, is not in the border.
        ## 3. If it is in the border, mark that Island as Invalid island and after traversal donot include in the count
