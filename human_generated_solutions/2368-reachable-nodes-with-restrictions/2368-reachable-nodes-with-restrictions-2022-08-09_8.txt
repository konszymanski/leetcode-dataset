        #####
        #Obviously none of 0\'s neighbors have been visited but...
        #...for rest of the nodes, you don\'t want to traverse backwards and get stuck
        #The reason why you will get stuck if you don\'t do the difference operation is because:
        #The edge comes in pairs. So [0,1] means that 0 will have 1 in its adjacency set. However...
        #...1 will also have 0. If you do not account for this, when you get to node 1 in the dict...
        #...all of 1\'s neighbors INCLUDING 0 will be added to the traversalQueue. Thus an infinite loop occurs.
        #####
        #Add the neighbors to the traversalQueue
        #Add all neighbors to counting set
        #Remove node from traversalQueue FIFO style. At the start that will obviously be node 0.
        #Repeat until you have traversed all nodes
