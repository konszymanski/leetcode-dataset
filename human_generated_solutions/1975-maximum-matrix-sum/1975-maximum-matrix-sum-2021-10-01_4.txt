# Approach 1: 
# Find the absolute sum of all the numbers in the matrix
# Find the absolute value of the smallest number in the matrix
# Count of negative numbers in the matrix
#   If count of negatives is even, then all elements can be made positive by performing the operation, so just return the total sum of the matrix
#   If count of negatives is odd, then we can make the smallest number in the matrix as negative and then return the sum
# NOTE : Here the result will be sum-2*minElement as you are not including this element.
