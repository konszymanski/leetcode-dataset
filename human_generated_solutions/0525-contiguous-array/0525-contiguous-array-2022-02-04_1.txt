let me explain you the approach \uD83D\uDE04 :
        1.we are going to use hash map  to store the count of 0 and 1
        2.we are going to declare a variable max_len and count assign it to 0
        3.we are going to use a for loop to iterate through the array
        4.if the current number is 0 then we will decrement the count by 1
        5.if the current number is 1 then we will increment the count by 1
        6. we are going to check that our count is equal to 0  are not if it 0 then we will make our max_len equal to i+1 .let me explain you why so keep following the logic \uD83D\uDE04.

        7. we are going to update our count to our hash .if it was already in the hash we will compare the value of the hash with max_len and if it is greater than max_len then we will update max_len to the value of the hash
        if it was not there we will add the count to the hash
            key --> count
            value --> index
        8. we are going to return max_len

        let me break down the logic \uD83D\uDE04
                hash={}
                max_len=0
                count=0
                nums=[0,1,1,0,1,1]

                our loop starts \uD83D\uDE0A
                first iteration:
                    i=0
                    current_num=nums[i] -->0
                    here our current_num is 0 so count=count-1
                    count=-1
                    -1 is not in our hash so we are going to add in our hash
                    hash={ \'-1\': 0 }
                second iteration:
                    i=1
                    count=-1
                    current_num=nums[i] -->1
                    here our current_num is 1 so count=count+1
                    count=-1+1 = 0
                    --> we got our count is equal to 0 so we will update our max_len to i+1 so max_len is 2
                         let me explain you why :
                            initially we declared our count to 0
                            we will increment our count when current_num is 1 and decrement when current_num is 0
                            then will update our max_len to i+1
                        Note:
                            when even we get out count is equal to 0 it mean we have equal number of 0 and 1
                    0 is not in our hash so we are going to add in our hash
                    hash={ \'0\': 1, \'-1\': 0 }
