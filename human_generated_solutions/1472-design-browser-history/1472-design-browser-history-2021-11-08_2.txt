    We use two stacks here because anytime we\'ll need to go forward or backward to the 
    most recent page we were at. A Stack helps us accomplish exactly that
    
    Eg: We are at "YouTube" -> We then visit "Facebook" -> We then visit "Google"
    At this point our prevStack = ["YouTube", "Facebook"]
    If we called back(1), we need to go to Facebook (which was the most recent before Google)
        - We need to go back to Facebook (top of our prevStack rn)
        - But we need to add our curPage to the forward stack because I called forward(1) after this operation, I would need to go back to Google
        
    You should be able to do the same analysis for forward(steps) 
    
    This should help you see the intuition behind using 2 stacks and the general logic

    def __init__(self, homepage: str):
        self.curPage = homepage # We keep track of the page we are currently on
        self.prevStack = [] # We keep track of the pages if we were to go back 
        self.forwardStack = [] # We keep track of the pages if we were to go forward

    def visit(self, url: str) -> None:
        \'\'\'
        Step 1: Since we\'re visiting a new page from curPage (our current page/url), if we go back, we need to go back to curPage first, hence add curPage to the top of prevStack
        
        Step 2: Reset forwardStack as mentioned in question
        
        Step 3: Now we need to make sure we update our current page correctly
        \'\'\'
        
        
        self.prevStack.append(self.curPage) # Step 1
        self.forwardStack = [] # Step 2
        self.curPage = url # Step 3
        

    def back(self, steps: int) -> str:
        
        \'\'\'
        
        Algorithm: 
            Step 0. Keep repeating until we still have to go back
            Step 1. If we\'re going to go back from our curPage to page X, if we go forward from page X, we need to land at curPage, so add it to the forwardStack
            Step 2. We need to go back now so update the curPage as needed and remove it from the prevStack
            Step 3. We went back one more step at this point, so decrement possible by 1
        
        \'\'\'
        
        possible = min(steps, len(self.prevStack)) # In order to hamdle cases where steps > len(self.prevStack) ,we take the minimum of the two at all times
        
        while possible:  # Step 0
            self.forwardStack.append(self.curPage) # Step 1
            self.curPage = self.prevStack.pop() # Step 2
            possible -= 1 # Step 3 
        
            
        return self.curPage # We need to return the page we\'re at currently
