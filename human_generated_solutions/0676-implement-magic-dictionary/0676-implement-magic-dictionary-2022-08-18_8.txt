/*
we can approach this problem using trie. Problem is very similar to 
Add and search word data structures.
We can create a standard trie and search for words in that.
if at all, we come across a character which is not present down the path,
we still continue to see if word is still searchable. If we are able to find the 
remaining word, we return True else we return False
