        #     Explanation: Our array "S" must be generally sorted as [0]*a + [1]*b

        #         - We can sweep through each configuration computing their cost
        # To get started, we assume that we have an array of 1\'s (111), and every zero must be changed
        # Compute this cost:
        cost = 0

        #     Now we will start allowing zeros up to x=S[i] (last allowed zero)
        #         Check how many zeros can stay for free, and..
        #         How many 1\'s must be force to change as we advance

        for x in S: # last 0 allowed

                cost -= 1 # this "zero" no longer is a problem (subtract from original cost)
            else:
                cost += 1 # this "one" must be forced to change (higher cost)
