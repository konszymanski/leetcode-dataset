let me explain you the approach \uD83D\uDE04 :
        1.let initialize our result as 0
        2. we will run our while loop until num becomes < 10 which means it is single digit
        3. How we will separate the digits?
            Modulus operator %:
                use of modulus operator % is to get last digit of num and if we divide the num by 10 it will remove the last digit.
            we will use modulus operator to get the last digit and then divide the num by 10
            so we will get the last digit and then divide the num by 10 
        4. we will check our base case \uD83D\uDE04
            if result is < 10 then we will return result
        5. we will sum the last digit and num /10 which is quotient then we will assign result and num repeat the process
             num/10 --> quotient     
             result = quotient  + last digit
     For Example:
            num=98
            result=0
            first iteration:
                last digit= 98 % 10 = 8
                quotient = 98 / 10 = 9 
                result=8+9=17
                num=17
            second iteration:
                last digit= 17 % 10 = 7
                quotient = 17 / 10 = 1 
                result=8
                num=8
            third iteration:
                
                This hit our base case so we will return result as 8
