/*
initialize val to 1
initialize answer set with starting index
Algo
Go in infinite loop
   Go right val times, if the index is valid, add all those indexes to answer set
   Go Down val times, if the index is valid, add all those indexes to answer set
   Go Left val+1 times, if the index is valid, add all those indexes to answer set
   Go Up val + 1 times, if the index is valid, add all those indexes to answer set
   if the answer set has rows*cols entries, break out of loop and return the answer set
