What the Question asking us to do \uD83E\uDD14 ?
    Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

    Approach Explanation :
        1. we will create  hashmap to count the frequency of the number
        2. we will create a new array to store the k most frequent elements
        3. we will find the frequency of the number and store it in the hashmap
        4. we will iterate through the hashmap and store the k most frequent elements in the new array
        5. we will return the new array
Big o:
    n-->size of the nums
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(n+n) --> O(n)
