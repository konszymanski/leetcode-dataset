    6 June 2020.
    DP - Bottom up.
    Look at the solution as to how it was done.    
    
    T: O(N^2). The use of the double for loops.
    S: O(N^2). The lengths of the dictionary in dp follows this order: 0, 1, 2, 3,...n. That\'s N^2.
    
    **The literal running time varies with LC. This same solution ran in 2.1ms and 1.1ms.**
    **The literal space time is consistent at like 150MB which is insanely high but beats 80%. **
