idea of  backtrack
the main reason we ar using backtracking is that at current position (state)
we have multiple options, we do not know which one is optimal so we want to
try them one by one:
    1) if we found some options contradict the restraints, we return to previous position (state)
    2) if we continue to the end and the option is correct,  we add it to the final result
    so we need pay attention to three aspect (or three key words):
        1) options (O), 2)restraints (R), 3) termination (T, which is the search is complete and add to final results
    
we introduce some variables need to used in backtrack:
1) global variable: use to store the result (such as self.res)
2) parameters: 
    1) state parameters or variable: the correct result need to be saved 
        to the global variable
    2) condition parameters: the initialized parameters for each search,
        come from last state, these parameters determine whether we continue to
        search at current position (state) or return (because of restraints)
3) conditions of completion or return: whether the current parameters validate
        the restraints or we can conitnue 
4) process of recursion

# naive template for backtrack
# advanced method would include memorization to avoid replicate search

res = []    # define the global variable to store the final result
state = []  # define the state parameters
p,q,r       # define the condition parameters
def back(state\uFF0Ccondition1\uFF0Ccondition2\uFF0C\u2026\u2026):
    if #1. violate the restraints(R)
        return
    elif #2. meet the termiantion (T)
        res.append(state)   # add to final result
        return 
    
    for #3. process of recursion, usually is a loop to try all possibility 
        if  # meet some required condition, usually given by the problem
            back(state\uFF0Ccondition1\uFF0Ccondition2\uFF0C\u2026\u2026)
return res
