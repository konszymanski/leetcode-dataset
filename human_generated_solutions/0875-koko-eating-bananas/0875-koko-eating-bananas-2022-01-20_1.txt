## **Method 1: Brute Force** *[Gives TLE]*
Intuitively we can take these steps:
1. Simply consider the initial speed k to be 1.
2. Calculate the total time T required to finish all the  piles.
3. If T is greater than the given time limit H, we increment k and repeat steps 1, 2, 3
4. If T is <= H then we return k as our answer.
