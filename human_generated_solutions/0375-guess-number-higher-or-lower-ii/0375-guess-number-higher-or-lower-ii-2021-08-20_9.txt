    #the idea of my solution is to find the best case in worst case. what does it mean? 
    #we know the big interval relys on small interval, so we will only study the smallest case
    #if the interval is 0, dp[i][i] what is the value of this interval? it has to be 0, because you dont need to guess
    #what if the interval is 2, impossible to have interval 1, interval is 2 the value should be the smaller number
    #lets look at this example: [1,2] [2,3] you definatly gonna pick the cheap one, because after you pick one the answer
    #will be the another. 
    #because all the even interval will rely on the dp of interval 2, so once the dp[i][i + 1] is solved, the whole problem is solved !
