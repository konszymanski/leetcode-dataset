        Consider the numbers are in range 1-n.
        We need to check for all numbers from 1 to n for which the total penalty is minimum.
        Suppose we guessed a number k between 1-n, therefore, our penalty would be =>
            k + max(penalty for numbers in the range 1 to k-1, penalty for numbers in the range k+1 to n)
            as after every guess we would know when the target is lower than or greater than our guess.
        Now we just need to find the penalty for all k in the range 1-n and the k which gives the minimum penalty would be our answer.
