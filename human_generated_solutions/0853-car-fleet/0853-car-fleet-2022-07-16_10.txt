Note:

1. A car from behind even if its speeder than the car at front, it cannot overtake. This becomes the condition for multiple cars to be in same fleet.

2. Since a car cannot overtake another car, a car at front always remain car at front and car at back always remains a car at back.

3. For this reason, reverse the initial position in descending order. 

4. calculate the time taken for each car to reach destination

5. If a car at back is faster than car at front, they become one same fleet(at a point they reach same position and then they travel together)
