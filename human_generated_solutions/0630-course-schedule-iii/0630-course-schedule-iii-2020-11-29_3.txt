        # Scenario [1]:
        \'\'\'
        - Can take course because If I start the course now at t=time I will be able to finish it before its deadline
            - append the course to the heap
            - increment timer
        \'\'\'
        
        # Scenario [2]:
        \'\'\'
        - Cannot take course because If I start the course now at t=time I will NOT be able to finish it before its deadline
            - check the course with the longest duration that we have decided we\'re gonna take so far
                - Compare the curr course against that course and swap if the duration of cur course is greater than the course with longest duration so far
                - Why we are doing this you ask? Because this means that there is a course that we decided previously we could take but in reality its affecting
                  our ability to take more shorter courses. And since the priority is to take more courses -> we decide to sacrifice the long course when we 
                  encounter a course that is shorter in duration in hopes we can maximize the number of courses we can take.
                
                - The test upon which we base our decision is simple : Is the curr course shorter than the longest course we are planning to take so far?
                    - if yes: -> we swap for the reasons explained above
                    - if no: -> we do nothing and skip the iteration becuz the cur course is either as long as the (longest course so far) or even longer
                        which means doing any modification is not gonna help us take more courses
        \'\'\'
        
        # Note (A):
        \'\'\'
        - The duration of course is the only piece of info needed about the course
