    Least Frequently Used Class with O(1) average get() and put()

    1. Initialized with a capacity

    3. If there are multiple elements with the same usage count, then the least recently used element is evicted
        to break the tie

    Approach:

    1. Store the capacity, current number of elements, and the min_use_count value as fields on the object
    2. Maintain a map of key -> DLL Node for O(1) lookups of elements
    3. Maintain a map of usage_count -> DoubleLinkedList (DLL) to enable LFU and LRU properties
        - Each bucket has a DLL that is sorted by most recently used to least recently used
        - We enable LFU by tracking the min_use_count so we can find the LFU bucket in O(1)
        - We enabled LRU by maintaining an LRU ordering of the DLL nodes per bucket, so the LRU item is last
