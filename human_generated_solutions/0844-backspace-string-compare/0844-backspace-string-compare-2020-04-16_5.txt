# IDEA: use two indexes to scan strings in reverse, on every step move indexes back by at least 1 but if # encountered keep moving farther backwards
#       compare characters at indexes and return False if not equal; return True at the end if both strings were scanned fully
#       O(N) time, O(1) space
#
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        i, j = len(S), len(T) # two indexes, start outside of string to make loop simpler
        
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            back = 1 # backspace counter, move back at least one character
            while back > 0:
                i -= 1
                back += 1 if i >= 0 and S[i] == \'#\' else -1 # if hashtag found increase backspace counter, otherwise decrease it

            back = 1
            while back > 0:
                j -= 1
                back += 1 if j >= 0 and T[j] == \'#\' else -1
            
            if i >= 0 and j >= 0 and S[i] != T[j]: # done with backspaces, compare current character
                return False
        
        return i < 0 and j < 0 # return True if both indexes passed both strings fully
