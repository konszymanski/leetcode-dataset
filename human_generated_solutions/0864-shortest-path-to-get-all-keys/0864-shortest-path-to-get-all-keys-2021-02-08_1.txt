w: minimum steps  --> BFS
h: we have additional interesting conditions here 
    we can go to A if we have key a
    then we might need to store more information than just (x,y) in regular graph 
    traversal problem
    
note that for each cell, we can travese more than once since in some cases we need 
to grab the key and then return to a previous place and start searching again. so we should not add the position when we append the position to the queue
