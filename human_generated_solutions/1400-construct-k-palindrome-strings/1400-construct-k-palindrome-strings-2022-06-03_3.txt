        For a palindrome, its odd-count character has to be less than or eqaul to one. 
        Then in order to get k many palindromic substrings, the number of odd-count chracters in s has to be less than
        or equal to k \'\'\'
        
        if len(s) < k:
            return False
        freq = Counter(s)
        return sum(1 for val in freq.values() if val % 2 != 0) <= k
