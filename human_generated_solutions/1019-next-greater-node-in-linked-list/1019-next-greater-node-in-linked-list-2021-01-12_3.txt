w: linked list + stack
   for such type of question, we could only know the value of node when we get there,
   then using a stack to store the previous information should do the job, the key here is 
   how to construct the stack. In stead of only storing the value, we store (value, index) so
   we can modify the final result in O(1) on the fly
h:  1) create a list res to store the result
    2) every time we walk along the linked list
        1) we append 0 to res
            if the current val > stack[-1][0]:
                we keep pop and change res[StoredIndex] = current val
		2) we append (current val, current index) to a stack
