Question asking us to return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

Example:
    s=\'code\'
    t=\'leetcode\'
    here s is subsequence of t ,we can get code from leetcode.


What is subsequence and subString?
    Subsequence: a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
    SubString: a contiguous sequence of symbols that appears in the same relative order as the original string.
  
  
  Big O:
    Time: O(n) # n is the length of t
    Space: O(1)
