# Get length of LL:
node = head
n = 0
while node:  # TC = O(n)
	n += 1
	node = node.next  # ++

# Calc. length of parts to be:
each, remained = divmod(n, k)  # n//k, n%k

# Do partitions:
parts = []  # SC = O(k)
for _ in range(k):  # TC = O(k * n/k) = O(n)
	n_ = each + bool(remained)  # len of partition
	# print(n_)  #debugging

	parts.append(head)
	for _ in range(n_-1):  # go to the last node of this LL part; TC = O(n/k)
		head = head.next  # ++
	if n_:  # or `if head`
		head.next, head = None, head.next  # break (partition) LL, ++

	if remained:  # update "extra-nodes" count
		remained -= 1

return parts
