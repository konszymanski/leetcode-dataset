Explanation: In the first sentence as mentioned, we can have at max 4 bytes, Based on the below table 
1. 1 byte UTF8 encoding should start with 0 as most significant
2. 2 Bytes UTF8  encoding should start with 110XXX.. and 10XXX .. Example: Given a data [197,130,1] , here 197 after converting to binary will become 11000101, here we can see clearly its a 2 byte UTF8 encoding which means we need to check one more number after 197 that i.e, 130 in this example is having a binary value starting with 10XX.. or not, if it does not start with that value we can return. Once we have completed checking 130 number as well then we can once again check for next digit i.e., 1 in this example to find the how many byte encoding this number in UTF8
3. 3 Bytes UTF8 encoding will start with 1110XX.. , 10XX.. and 10XXX.. as mentioned in the table. In this case if the first number is belonging to 3 byte UTF8 encoding then we need to check the next two numbers are having 10 in their binary representation. after that we can process the next element
4. Same for the 4 byte encoding

Note: we don\'t have a UTF8 encoding starting byte with 10XX..
