We will try to make every unique pairs of subarrays possible

We can se we have a choice to either continue the subarray or create new , this gives the idea
of DP ( multiple recursions are happending)

Now dp needs recursion and memoization

Recursion requires recursive cases and base case

RECURSIVE CASES

For every index we have two choices:
1. Continue the subarray 
2. Break the subarray and start a new one

for 1st case we can continue if and only if size of subarray is less than k

BASE CASE

When index == len(arr) : we return max in subarray * size of subarray

MEMOIZATION
Now all we need to do is to apply DP memoization
we memoize the parameters which are variable (changing)
