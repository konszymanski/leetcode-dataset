#bisect_right(start, p) gives you the number of flowers that are in full bloom at person p.
#bisect_left(end, p) gives you number of flowers that are not in full bloom at person p.
#we have to tighten our bound to get exact number of flowers that are in bloom or not, thats why we are using right and left of bisect module.
