Hello guys \uD83D\uDE00 !

Given question:
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in   ascending order` ,
an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Question Explanation:
    basically, we need to check if the target is in the array. using binary search.
	
	Big O:
    n--> number of elements in the array
    Time Complexity: O(log(n)) - because we are using binary search
    Space Complexity: O(1)
