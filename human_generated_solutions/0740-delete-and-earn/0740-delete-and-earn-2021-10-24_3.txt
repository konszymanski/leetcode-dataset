            This question is similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber.
            The only difference here is we need to first calculate the money in each house.
            Let us consider, we have houses from 0 to max(nums). Now each time a number occurs in nums, we add that number to its corresponding house.
            At the end we will left with houses and the money they have.
