        #   If they have same prime factor, X must exist

        #   1. Get all count of each number
        #   2. Use gcd to check
        #   3. Return result
        
        # 1. Get all count of each number
        #    I take value from set arbitrarily rather than pop
        #    So that I didn\'t need to dealing one value case

        gcd_val = next(iter(cnt_set))
