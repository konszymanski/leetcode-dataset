/*
tldr: identify the total number of components and 
return the len of stones - # of connected components
we can do a simple depth first traversal by create a graph
all the stones having same row are connected
all the stones having same column are connected
graph = {(\'r\', r): {set of stones belonging to same row }, 
(\'c\', c): {set of stones belonging to same column}}
start with a stone which is unvisited and do a dfs traversal on that. 
Identify the number of connected components
