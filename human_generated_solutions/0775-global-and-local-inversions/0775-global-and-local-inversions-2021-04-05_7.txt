Every local inversion is also a Global inversion
So we only have to check whether there are any other global inversions i.e.The inversion separated by more than one index
So we track the maximum value seen before the previous value of the current element i.e.max_before_prev=max(max_before_prev,A[i-1])
If this max_before_prev is greater than the current element then it means that we have a global inversion separated by more than one index and hence return False
