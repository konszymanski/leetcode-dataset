        is_block shows if we\'re in a block comment or not
        Iterate over current line and detect line comments or start/end of block comments.
        End line early for a line comment, update is_block for block start/end and continue
        Only create new res_line if we reach the end of a line and is_block is false. 
            This accounts for test cases like ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"] -> ["ab"].
