/* 
I was able to solve this using Hints
Store the count of computers in each row and column
identify the ones that are isolated
iterate over matrix again and see 
if grid[i][j] == 1 then,
	if number of computers in jth col > 1, simply add col[j] to answer
	if number of computers in jth col == 1, check row[i]
		if row[i] == 1, computer is isolated, leave it
		if row[i] > 1, computer is not isolated, add that to answer
	return answer
