# Suppose {A:6,B:4,C:2} n = 2 then we can fill the slot  in the matrix for clear visualization
	# At every row there will be three element since n = 2
	# So [
	#		[ A  , B , C ],
	#		[ A  , B , C ],
	#		[ A , B , idle],
	#		[ A , B , idle ],
	#		[ A, idle , idle ],
	#       [ A , empty ,empty ]
	#    Here we can see that for first 5 row number of element is 
	#     (maxfreq - 1) * ( number of element in column i.e (n + 1)
	
	#    For last row there might be all all three n + 1 element or less than that ,which depends upon 
	#    frequency  of  elements in array.So we handle that case diffrently.
	
	#    For calculating number of element in last row,we can check how many character have
	
	#    max frequency which value of  last_row
	# So final answer will be 
					#    ans = (number of row - 1) * ( column) + number of element in last row
