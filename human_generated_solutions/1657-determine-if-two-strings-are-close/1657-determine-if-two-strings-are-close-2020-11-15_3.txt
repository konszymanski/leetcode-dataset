# Submission: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/420404393/
# (Time, Space) Complexity : O(n), O(n)
# 1. Check length for shortcut
# 2. Check set for consist of character
# 3. Check count count for consist of count
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        return len(word1) == len(word2) \\
            and set(word1) == set(word2) \\
            and Counter(Counter(word1).values()) == Counter(Counter(word2).values())
