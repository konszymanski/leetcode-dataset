Say number = x and target = target

When target == 1: we can make it by using only one way i.e. x/x
Now we start with our current value cur = x

Now fastest way to reach the target is via multplication
		Example x = 5 target = 125
		What is the fastest way to reach 125 with x = 5 and operations = (/,*,+,-)
		We can try 5*5*5 using only 2 operators

declare op = 0 (operators used )
So we multiply cur by x until cur >= target and do op += 1

Now if cur == target : we can reach the target by operations = op

If op == 0:
   i.e.  during the start the target was smaller than x
   example target = 2 and x = 3
   one way to reach the target is : 1 + solve(target - 1)
													  to make one we do x/x and inluding + operator we have used total 2 operators

else:
   i.e. we used  * operator some no. of times
   so what we do is reach the nearest value to target via * such that reachede value < target
   i.e. say x = 3 and target = 12
   So we do multiply cur like 3*3*3 = 27 
   Now 27/3 is the nearest number smaller than target = 12 that we can reach via multiplication
   Now solve for ( target - cur/x) and 1 operation for + and op
   
Final check :
   if cur - target < target :
    i.e. we can reach target by substraction and division from cur
	So tmp = op + 1 + solve(cur-target)
	if tmp is smaller than ans then ans = tmp
finally store ans of target in dp
return ans
