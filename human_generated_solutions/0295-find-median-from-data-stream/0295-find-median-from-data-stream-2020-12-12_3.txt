class MedianFinder:
    
    \'\'\'
    We have a max heap representing the sorted left half of the stream, and a min heap representing the sorted right half of the stream.
    The tops of these heaps represent the middle of the stream so far.
    
    To get the median:
        - if len(left) == len(right): return (left[0] + right[0]) / 2
        - elif len(left) > len(right): return left[0]
        - else: return right[0]
        
    To add a number x:
        If x <= left[0], add to left. Else, add to right.
        If abs(len(left) - len(right)) > 1: rebalance heaps.
        
    To rebalance:
        Pop an element from the bigger heap and add it to the smaller heap.
        
    Adding a number: O(log n) time, as there could be at most 2 pushes and 1 pop (log n).
    Finding the median: O(1), since we just look at the 0th elements of the heaps.
    Space: O(n), since we store every element in the heaps.
