       return self.checkOverlaps_boundryCount() # --- Approach 1 : boundary count
       # return self.checkOverlaps_heap() # --------- Approach 2 : sort + heap => number of rooms needed

    # NOTE [1]
    # if there was a limit on the overlaps (like in My Calender I & II) -> we could have used a local overlaps counter and simply break when th e number of overlaps exceeds limit
    # however, in this problme because we have no limit -> we cannot afford to use a single counter because eventually the total sum = 0 when we finish traversing the entire list lst (an equal number of +1, -1)
    # that\'s why we have to have another global counter (maxOverlaps) and keep updating it with every iteration -> because we want to capture the number of overlpas
