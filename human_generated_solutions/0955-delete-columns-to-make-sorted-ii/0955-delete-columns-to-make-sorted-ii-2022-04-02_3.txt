We need to make the strs array sorted .
We can remove a column

take index i = 0
There can be three cases (till index i ):
     1. Strs is sorted and no element is equal ( similar till index i)
     2. Strs is sorted but we have similar strings ( till index i )
     3. Strs is unsorted
 
 For Case 1:
    Since our strs is sorted : return the ans

For Case 2:
   Since we are not sure if our strs is sorted by looking till index i , increment i 
   
For Case 3:
  Since our strs is unsorted . however we know that excluding index i 
   i.e. strs[0:i] is sorted 
   
   So we remove the i th column .
